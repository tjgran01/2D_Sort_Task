While you are performing the task, you will sometimes hear a voice chime in asking for ANY object to be placed in a certain bin. This voice will begin by issueing a call to a specific callsign.

If the voice references your callsign (Bravo), you should follow the instructions given by the voice. If the voice does not reference your callsign, you can ignore the request.

Your callsign, (Bravo), is posted on the monitor of the computer so you can reference it throughout the task as needed.
